Part 1: Background

- Present background material on financial markets
- Present background material on ML applied to finance

Part 2: Building a model

- Decide on some fixed training data (time-series of stock prices + other features) and some (flexible, adaptive) form for our model (mixture model, HMM, SVM regression, ensemble, etc.)
- Train our model to 'understand' stock price dynamics. This will enable our model to make predictions of future stock prices, given a test example. 

Part 3: Constructing an optimal portfolio

- Use the model constructed in the previous section to select and optimize a portfolio. 
- Compare the performance of our portfolio with the alternatives (other funds, obligations, money-in-the-bank) to assess the success of our project.
